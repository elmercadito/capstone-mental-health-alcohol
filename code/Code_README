## Code Overview

This folder contains the Stata do-files used to construct the analytic sample,
produce descriptive statistics, and estimate the main econometric models for the
Honours Capstone Project using CCHS 2019–2020 PUMF data.

### `summary_stats.do`
Constructs the cleaned analytic sample from the CCHS 2019–2020 PUMF by applying
sample restrictions (adults aged 18+, valid mental health responses, nonmissing
alcohol-use measures), recoding the mental health outcome variable, and generating
descriptive and summary statistics used to characterize the sample in the paper.

The do-file sets the working directory, loads the microdata, defines the final
estimation sample, and produces summary outputs for key demographic, health,
and alcohol-consumption variables.

### `Regression.do`
Implements the main econometric analysis using weighted logistic regression models.
The do-file constructs a binary mental health outcome variable, applies survey
weights, and estimates models examining the association between alcohol consumption
and mental health outcomes while controlling for demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics.

This file contains the core inferential results discussed in the capstone paper,
including the primary regression specifications.
